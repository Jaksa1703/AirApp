## Description
This is a simple web application, built using Django and Bootstrap, that allows users to retrieve air quality information in capitals of provinces in Polnd, based on postal codes.
The app utilizes an API, provided by GIOÅš (https://powietrze.gios.gov.pl/pjp/content/api), to fetch air quality data for a given location and displays it to the user.
